This repository is designed to demonstrate FDG-PET image processing and analysis for an educational course at the Annual Meeting of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping.

Example datasets: 

* [The energetic costs of the human connectome](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004513/versions/1.0.4) from OpenNeuro.

* A smaller dataset containing PET data from one participant and preprocessed PET data from nine participants is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m2hKlu3Sy8vfOxcfaWCYzfdEn2o_TQpf/view?usp=drive_link).

The code is written in MATLAB, and requires SPM software to run.
